1. Clone this repo.
2. Ensure that you have Node installed on your development machine ( windows, linux or other)
   Follow the tutorial here to install the latest version of node https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-node-js-and-npm/

   After Node /NPM  is installed on your system, run the two commands below to deploy
   
   <code>npm install  #installs dependencies</code>

   <code>npm run dev  #to deploy the code</code>
   <i> You might have to run the npm audit fix if prompted to do so. Dont worry the app wont break by doing so</i>

   On your local machine, pull up the browser and go to this address localhost:5173

   NOTE! I will be updating this often so please be cautious with adding allot of your data and updating your version of QuadParts with newer versions of the app released here. Currently fixing the database export function to combat this issue.
   I plan on releasing android, windows and linux standalone versions of this app as well. 
  Currently working on the docker-compose version of this app.
